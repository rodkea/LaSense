# LASENSE

## Description

This graphical user interface (GUI) is designed to support a project that utilizes the dynamic laser speckle technique. This method is employed to differentiate filamentous fungi from motile bacteria on soft surfaces such as agar plates. 

The application is built with PyQt5 and operates on a Raspberry Pi 4 equipped with a camera (PiCam). It captures and processes video footage of the samples to facilitate faster and more accurate discrimination between fungi and bacteria compared to conventional techniques. 

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- **Raspberry Pi 4** with **PiCam**.
- **Python** installed on your system.
- **PyQt5**: Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
